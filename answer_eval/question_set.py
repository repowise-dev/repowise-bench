"""Loading the retrieval question set.

The set is JSONL - one question per line - so a diff shows exactly which
questions a change added or reworded, which a single JSON array would not.

Every validation here raises. None of it warns and continues. A question set
that loses a question, or reads a mistyped key as "this question expects
nothing", still produces a score, and that score is worse than no score at all
because it looks like a measurement.

Line format::

    {"id": "q001", "question": "Where is X?",
     "expected_paths": ["packages/core/src/repowise/core/cache.py::invalidate"]}

``expected_paths`` holds the ``path`` values the answer tool puts on each
retrieval hit. Those are target paths - a file path, optionally with a symbol
suffix - and not the internal page id. The two are written in different spaces
and a question set must be written in the space the tool actually returns.

``tags`` is the one optional key. Blank lines and ``#`` comment lines are
skipped.
